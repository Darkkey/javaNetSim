# javaNetSim

Simple visual network simulator (used in SPb ETU "LETI" in Distributed Systems 101 and Networking 101 courses).

Warning: this is a very old piece of software, that I've created in 2004-2006 years. This repository is created only for supporting this software, porting to new java versions and fixing bugs. See README.txt for more information.
